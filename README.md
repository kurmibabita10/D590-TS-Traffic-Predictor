## Traffic Forecasting App for Urban Cities
This traffic forecasting application will help urban commuters, transportation authorities, and city planners by predicting future traffic conditions. While there are several applications (like Google Maps, Waze) that provide real-time traffic data, they do not predict future traffic. My project will focus on forecasting traffic conditions by considering a wide range of factors such as weather conditions, holidays, and time of day.
