# D590-TS-Traffic-Predictor

## Traffic Forecasting App for Urban Cities
This traffic forecasting application will help urban commuters, transportation authorities, and city planners by predicting future traffic volumes. While there are several applications (like Google Maps, Waze) that provide real-time traffic condition, they do not predict future traffic volume. The goal is to predict traffic patterns by integrating various factors such as time of the day, weather conditions, holidays, and special events to generate more accurate traffic predictions.
